              "[\"Hello everyone! I hope you enjoyed Alexander's first lecture. I'm Ava and in this second lecture, Lecture 2, we're going to focus on this question of sequence modeling - how we can build neural networks that can handle and learn from sequential data. So in Alexander's first lecture he introduced the essentials of neural networks starting with perceptrons building up to feed forward models and how you can actually train these models and start to think about deploying them forward. Now we're going to turn our attention to specific types of problems that involve sequential processing of data and we'll realize why these types of problems require a different way of implementing and building neural networks from what we've seen so far. And I think some of the components in this lecture traditionally can be a bit confusing or daunting at first but what I really really want to do is to build this understanding up from the foundations walking through step by step developing intuition all the way to understanding the math and the operations behind how these networks operate. Okay so let's let's get started to to begin I to begin I first want to motivate what exactly we mean when we talk about sequential data or sequential modeling. So we're going to begin with a really simple intuitive example let's say we have this picture of a ball and your task is to predict where this ball is going to travel to next. Now if you don't have any prior information about the trajectory of the ball it's motion it's history any guess or prediction about its next position is going to be exactly that a random guess. If however in addition to the current location of the ball I gave you some information about where it was moving in the past now the problem becomes much easier and I think hopefully we can all agree that most likely or most likely next prediction is that this ball is going to move forward to the right in in the next frame. So this is a really you know reduced down bare bones intuitive\",\n",
              " \"example but the truth is that beyond this sequential data is really all around us. As I'm speaking the words coming out of my mouth form a sequence of sound waves that define audio which we can split up to think about in this sequential manner similarly text language can be split up into a sequence of characters or a sequence of words and there are many many more examples in which sequential processing sequential data is present right from medical signals like EKGs to financial markets and projecting stock prices to biological sequences encoded in DNA to patterns in the climate to patterns of motion and many more and so already hopefully you're getting a sense of what these types of questions and problems may look like and where they are relevant in the real world when we consider applications of sequential modeling in the real world we can think about a number of different kind of problem definitions that we can have in our Arsenal and work with in the first lecture Alexander introduced the Notions of classification and the notion of regression where he talked about and we learned about feed forward models that can operate one to one in this fixed and static setting right given a single input predict a single output the binary classification example of will you succeed or pass this class here there's there's no notion of sequence there's no notion of time now if we introduce this idea of a sequential component we can handle inputs that may be defined temporally and potentially also produce a sequential or temporal output so for as one example we can consider text language and maybe we want to generate one prediction given a sequence of text classifying whether a message is a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment conversely we could have a single input let's say an image and our goal may be now to generate text or a sequential description of this image right given this image of a baseball player throwing a ball can we build a neural network that generates that\",\n",
              " \"as a language caption finally we can also consider applications and problems where we have sequence in sequence L for example if we want to translate between two languages and indeed this type of thinking in this type of Architecture is what powers the task of machine translation in your phones in Google Translate and and many other examples so hopefully right this has given you a picture of what sequential data looks like what these types of problem definitions may look like and from this we're going to start and build up our understanding of what neural networks we can build and train for these types of problems so first we're going to begin with the notion of recurrence and build up from that to Define recurrent neural networks and in the last portion of the lecture we'll talk about the underlying mechanisms underlying the Transformer architectures that are very very very powerful in terms of handling sequential data but as I said at the beginning right the theme of this lecture is building up that understanding step by step starting with the fundamentals and the intuition so to do that we're going to go back revisit the perceptron and move forward from there right so as Alexander introduced where we studied the perception perceptron in lecture one the perceptron is defined by this single neural operation where we have some set of inputs let's say X1 through XM and each of these numbers are multiplied by a corresponding weight pass through a non-linear activation function that then generates a predicted output y hat here we can have multiple inputs coming in to generate our output but still these inputs are not thought of as points in a sequence or time steps in a sequence even if we scale this perceptron and start to stack multiple perceptrons together to Define these feed forward neural networks we still don't have this notion of temporal processing or sequential information even though we are able to translate and convert multiple inputs apply these weight\",\n",

              " \"them to each other so we use neural network layers to do exactly this given this positional encoding what attention does is applies a neural network layer transforming that first generating the query we do this again using a separate neural network layer and this is a different set of Weights a different set of parameters that then transform that positional embedding in a different way generating a second output the key and finally this repeat this operation is repeated with a third layer a third set of Weights generating the value now with these three in hand the key the the query the key and the value we can compare them to each other to try to figure out where in that self-input the network should attend to what is important and that's the key idea behind this similarity metric or what you can think of as an attention score what we're doing is we're Computing a similarity score between a query and the key and remember that these query and Qui key values are just arrays of numbers we can Define them as arrays of numbers which you can think of as vectors in space the query Vector the query values are some Vector the key the key values are some other vector and mathematically the way that we can compare these two vectors to understand how similar they are is by taking the dot product and scaling it captures how similar these vectors are how whether or not they're pointing in the same direction right this is the similarity metric and if you are familiar with a little bit of linear algebra this is also known as the cosine similarity operation functions exactly the same way for matrices if we apply this dot product operation to our query in key matrices key matrices we get this similarity metric out now this is very very key in defining our next step Computing the attention waiting in terms of what the network should actually attend to within this input this operation gives us a score which defines how how the components of the input data are related to each other so\",\n",
              " \"given a sentence right when we compute this similarity score metric we can then begin to think of Weights that Define the relationship between the sequential the components of the sequential data to each other so for example in the this example with a text sentence he tossed the tennis ball to serve the goal with the score is that words in the sequence that are related to each other should have high attention weights ball related to toss related to tennis and this metric itself is our attention waiting what we have done is passed that similarity score through a soft Max function which all it does is it constrains those values to be between 0 and 1. and so you can think of these as relative scores of relative attention weights finally now that we have this metric that can captures this notion of similarity and these internal self-relationships we can finally use this metric to extract features that are deserving of high attention and that's the exact final step in this self-attention mechanism in that we take that attention waiting Matrix multiply it by the value and get a transformed transformation of of the initial data as our output which in turn reflects the features that correspond to high attention all right let's take a breath let's recap what we have just covered so far the goal with this idea of self-attention the backbone of Transformers is to eliminate recurrence attend to the most important features in in the input data in an architecture how this is actually deployed is first we take our input data we compute these positional encodings the neural network layers are applied three-fold to transform the positional encoding into each of the key query and value matrices we can then compute the self-attention weight score according to the up the dot product operation that we went through prior and then self-attend to these features to these uh information to extract features that deserve High attention what is so powerful about this approach in taking this\",\n",
              " \"attention wait putting it together with the value to extract High attention features is that this operation the scheme that I'm showing on the right defines a single self-attention head and multiple of these self-attention heads can be linked together to form larger Network architectures where you can think about these different heads trying to extract different information different relevant parts of the input to now put together a very very rich encoding and representation of the data that we're working with intuitively back to our Ironman example what this idea of multiple self-attention heads can amount to is that different Salient features and Salient information in the data is extracted first maybe you consider Iron Man attention had one and you may have additional attention heads that are picking out other relevant parts of the data which maybe we did not realize before for example the building or the spaceship in the background that's chasing iron man and so this is a key building block of many many many many powerful architectures that are out there today today I again cannot emphasize how enough how powerful this mechanism is and indeed this this backbone idea of self-attention that you just built up understanding of is the key operation of some of the most powerful neural networks and deep learning models out there today ranging from the very powerful language models like gpt3 which are capable of synthesizing natural language in a very human-like fashion digesting large bodies of text information to understand relationships in text to models that are being deployed for extremely impactful applications in biology and Medicine such as Alpha full 2 which uses this notion of self-attention to look at data of protein sequences and be able to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein just given sequence information alone and all the way even now to computer vision which will be the topic of our next lecture tomorrow where the same idea of attention\",\n",
              " \"that was initially developed in sequential data applications has now transformed the field of computer vision and again using this key concept of attending to the important features in an input to build these very rich representations of complex High dimensional data okay so that concludes lectures for today I know we have covered a lot of territory in a pretty short amount of time but that is what this boot camp program is all about so hopefully today you've gotten a sense of the foundations of neural networks in the lecture with Alexander we talked about rnns how they're well suited for sequential data how we can train them using back propagation how we can deploy them for different applications and finally how we can move Beyond recurrence to build this idea of self-attention for building increasingly powerful models for deep learning in sequence modeling all right hopefully you enjoyed we have um about 45 minutes left for the for the lab portion and open Office hours in which we welcome you to ask us questions uh of us and the Tas and to start work on the labs the information for the labs is is up there thank you so much for your attention foreign\"]"
