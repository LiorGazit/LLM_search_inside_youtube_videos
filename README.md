# Analyze a Youtube videos by asking the LLM
By [Lior Gazit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liorgazit/)  

**Description of the notebook:**  
Pick a Youtube video that you'd like to understand what value it brings you without having to spend the time to watch all of it.  
For instance: 
 * An hour long lecture about a topic you are looking to learn about, and your goal is know whether it touches on all key points before dedicating time to watch it.
 * Or a Ted talk that you'd like to summarize in a different language.  
The notebooks in this folder show how this can be done by leveraging the open source library `embedchain`.  

**Requirements:**  
* Open this notebook in a free [Google Colab instance](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
* This code picks OpenAI's API as a choice of LLM, so a paid **API key** is necessary.
