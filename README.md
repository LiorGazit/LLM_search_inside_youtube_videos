# Analyze a Youtube video by asking the LLM
By [Lior Gazit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liorgazit/)  

**Description of the notebook:**  
Pick a Youtube video that you'd like to understand what value it brings you without having to spend the time to watch all of it.  
For instance: an hour long lecture about a topic you are looking to learn about, and your goal is know whether it touches on all key points before dedicating time to watch it.  
This is with the intuition that if it were a PDF instead of a video, you'd be able to search through it.  

**Requirements:**  
* Open this notebook in a free [Google Colab instance](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
* This code picks OpenAI's API as a choice of LLM, so a paid **API key** is necessary.
